# EIP712

Signing data is a solved problem if all we care about are bytestrings. Unfortunately in the real world we care about complex meaningful messages. Hashing structured data is non-trivial and errors result in loss of the security properties of the system.

## How to use ðŸ¤”

To get started with this boilerplate, you just need to follow these simple steps:

1. Deploy demo contract with script

   ```
   npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/eip712/deploy_eip712_test.js
   ```

2. Connect to MetaMask in Remix


3. Click the `At Address` button to point the newly deployed contract address to the contract instance


4. Call `signTypedDataAsync` to get account signature

   ```
   node scripts/frontrunning/frontrunning.js
   ```
   
5. Fetch `R/S/V` from signature and call `testEIP712` function successfully
