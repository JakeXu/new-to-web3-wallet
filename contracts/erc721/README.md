# NFT (ERC-721)

ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 721 is the proposal identifier number. ERCs are application-level standards in the Ethereum ecosystem, they can be a smart contract standard for tokens such as ERC-20, the author of an ERC is responsible for building consensus with the Ethereum community, and once the proposal is reviewed and approved by the community, it becomes a standard. You can track the recent ERC proposal [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues).
