# Front-running

On-chain front-running refers to searchers or miners inserting their own transactions ahead of others by increasing `gas` or using other methods to capture value. In blockchain, miners can profit by packaging, excluding, or reordering transactions in the blocks they generate, and `MEV` is the measure of this profit.
